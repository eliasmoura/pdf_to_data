This is a example PDF to test the program parsing, processing and output of the data.
Since I do not want to put personal data on the public project. I decided to make this PDF to use in the CI test.

\begin{table}
    \caption{Your first table.}
    \label{tab:table1}
    \begin{tabular}{|l c r|} % <-- Alignments: 1st column left, 2nd middle and 3rd right, with vertical lines in between
      \textbf{Value 1} & \textbf{Value 2} & \textbf{Value 3}\\
      \hline
           & START         & 20\\
      06-1 & Some Stuff    & 10\\
      03-2 & This happened & 32\\
      10-3 & Other thing   & 75\\
      END  &               & 100\\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\end{document}
